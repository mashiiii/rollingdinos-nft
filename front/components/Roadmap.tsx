            Welcome to a collection of 10,000 Rolling Dinos NFTs - unique
            non-fungible tokens living on the Etherium blockchain. Dinosaurs are
            extinct, but they keep on rolling. Each rolling dino is
            programmatically generated from over 100 possible traits, including
            rolling objects, headwear, facial expressions, and more. Every
            rolling object comes with a unique utility from which every Dino
            holder can benefit - regardless of the rarity.
